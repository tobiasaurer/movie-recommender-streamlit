# recommender-systems 

#### Project Status: Finished

## Project Intro/Objective
Collection of different recommender systems packaged in a streamlit app.   
The purpose of this project is to learn about different recommender systems and how to deploy python code in a webapp via streamlit. 

### Methods Used
* Popularity-based recommendations
* User-based recommendations
* Item-based recommendations

### Technologies
* Python
  * pandas, jupyter, sklearn
* Regular expressions
* Streamlit
* API

## Project Description
The data used was provided by WBS-Coding School.  
  
Main goals of the project:  
* Build different recommender-systems. 
* Deploy said recommender-systems on a web-app using Streamlit.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Make sure to have the following libraries in your environment:
    - pandas
    - sklearn
    - streamlit
3. If you want to use the integrated API-functionality to receive streaming links with your recommendations:  
    - Subscribe to the Streaming Availability API on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability/pricing)
    - Enter your API-key into the api_keys.py file
4. Open your terminal and run the command "streamlit run <path to file 'app.py'>" 
5. A browser window will open up and display the webapp.
